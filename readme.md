instead of `require`d.

```

## Use

```js
import {hedges} from 'hedges'

console.log(hedges.length) //=> 162

console.log(hedges.slice(0, 10))
```

Yields:

```js
[ 'a bit',
  'about',
  'actually',
  'allege',
  'alleged',
  'almost',
  'almost never',
  'always',
  'and all that',
  'and so forth' ]
```
